# Machine Learning, MLB Playoff Data
Over the course of a (typical) season, all 30 teams generate a massive variety of data, with hopes of reaching the postseason and ultimately winning the World Series. By analyzing the end of season statistics from all 30 teams and applying supervised machine learning techniques learned in class, our goal in this project is to predict playoff teams. As such, our research question is: Can we predict, with reasonable accuracy, which teams will make it to the 2018 MLB playoffs?
